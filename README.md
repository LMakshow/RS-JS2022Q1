# lmakshow-JSFE2022Q1

### Hello! This is the repository for study projects I did on the RS School course in 2022. There was quite a few!

Each of the project is in its separate branch. Some of them are in different repositories. Here are projects and their deploys:

## HTML Builder

Deploy: https://lmakshow.github.io/RS-JS2022Q1/migration-newip-to-ts/ (might need to reload once as the data goes through sleeping Heroku)

News API portal and client built on Typescript somewhat based on the existing code. Adaptive layout, selectors to choose news sources in different languages and categories.

Deploy: https://lmakshow.github.io/RS-JS2022Q1/async-race/

**Take note:** As currently the server is offline, to check the deploy, one need to [clone repo sith the server](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api.git) and keep the server running during functionality review.

Another REST API client for a simple race game. User can create some cars with different colors and names (or generate 100 of them with a button click) and start a race that is fully server-controlled. Winners list is also stored on the server.
